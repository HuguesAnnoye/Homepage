<h1>Seminar at Statistics Flanders !</h1>
<p>On Monday, October 23, 2023 Statistics Flanders is organizing a seminar on microsimulations. Microsimulation is a technique that allows modeling future changes in complex social phenomena based on the behavior of individual units, such as individuals and households.</p>
<p>In addition to an introduction on microsimulations as a modeling technique, experts from inside and outside the Statistics Flanders network will present some concrete examples of policy-relevant microsimulation models. I have participated to this seminar by a joint talk with Tom Truyts :</p>
<pre><code>BEAMM-model (UCLouvain Saint-Louis): an online, open-access microsimulation model for taxes, social contributions and benefits.
BEAMM-model: Tom Truyts abd Hugues Annoye (UCLouvain Saint-Louis)</code></pre>
